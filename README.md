# Hi there!

I'm an evolutionary ecologist in the School of Life and Environmental Sciences at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au), Sydney, Australia. I lead [The Evolutionary and Sensory Ecology Lab](http://tomwhite.io), where we use lab and field experiments, modelling, and meta-analysis to answer questions of adaptive evolution and behaviour. 

## Projects

- [pavo](http://pavo.colrverse.com): an R package for the spectral and spatial analysis of colour in nature
- [lightr](http://lightr.colrverse.com): tools for importing and process diverse spectral data in R (lead by [Hugo Gruson](https://www.normalesup.org/~hgruson/))
- The [colRverse](https://colrverse.com): a growing community of packages for understanding the physiology, ecology, and evolution of biological colouration
